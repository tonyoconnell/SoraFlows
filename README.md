## Sora
Introduced by OpenAI, Sora is an advanced AI model capable of generating realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions. This tool has the unique ability to produce sophisticated videos up to 60 seconds in length, featuring highly detailed scenes, complex camera movements, and characters exhibiting a wide range of emotions. However, Sora is not yet available to the public.

It's important to note that since OpenAI's Sora is in its initial development phase, we plan to regularly update our curated list with new resources to enhance its capabilities.

We are dedicated to gathering the highest quality prompts for Sora, ensuring the best possible outcomes from its use. 

For development, we utilize NextJs and Tailwind CSS, which supports the creation of a highly interactive and visually appealing web interface for Sora. 

This platform serves as an online video editor specifically designed for Sora, providing a convenient web UI for users to create videos directly from their browsers.
